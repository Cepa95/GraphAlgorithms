The goal of this course is to acquire knowledge in graph theory, model discrete problems using graphs, apply appropriate methods to solve them, and determine the complexity of algorithms.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Graph Algorithms**
   - Understand and analyze fundamental algorithms in graph theory.

2. **Model Problems Using Graphs and Networks**
   - Represent real-world and theoretical problems as graphs or network structures.

3. **Evaluate Problem and Algorithm Complexity**
   - Assess the complexity of problems and algorithms in graph theory and complex networks.

4. **Identify Optimization Problems**
   - Distinguish between exact and heuristic methods for solving optimization problems.

5. **Apply Known Graph Algorithms**
   - Use established algorithms to solve problems related to graphs and complex networks.

6. **Develop New Algorithms**
   - Create, implement, and analyze new algorithms that utilize graph algorithms as fundamental components.
